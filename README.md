# Differential Swerve Drive Pathing Library

Welcome to the **Differential Swerve Drive Pathing Library**, designed specifically for 2-wheel differential swerve drive systems running on the REV Control Hub. This library provides pathing capabilities with built-in control systems and optional filtering for enhanced sensor fusion. It is ideal for teams and projects utilizing odometry and an IMU for precise movement and path execution.

---

## Features

- **Built-in PIDF Control**: Leverages the built-in PIDF (Proportional-Integral-Derivative with Feedforward) controller for accurate and smooth path following.
  
- **Optional Kalman Filter**: Includes optional support for Kalman filtering, which improves sensor data fusion and noise reduction. If no external position estimator is available, the Kalman filter functions like a low-pass filter.

- **Path Generation Options**:
  - **Splines**: Allows smooth, curving paths between waypoints for fluid movement.
  - **Straight Lines**: Supports simple, direct paths between two points.
  - **Turns**: Handles rotational movements, adjusting the robot's heading as needed.

- **3-Wheel Odometry Support**: Accurate positional tracking with 3-wheel odometry ensures reliable feedback during complex maneuvers.

- **IMU Integration**: Utilizes the REV Control Hub's built-in IMU for maintaining precise heading control throughout the robot's movement.

## System Requirements

### Hardware:
- 2-wheel differential swerve drive setup.
- REV Control Hub (Android-based device).
- 3-wheel odometry system.
- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for heading control.

### Software:
- REV Robotics SDK.
- Android-based environment configured for REV Control Hub.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the library and integrate it into your projectâ€™s build environment (e.g., Android Studio).
2. Ensure the REV SDK is properly installed and configured for your REV Control Hub system.
3. Connect your 3-wheel odometry and IMU sensors to the Control Hub.

## Key Components

- **Differential Swerve Drive**: The core class that manages the swerve drive system, handling pathing, sensor input, and movement execution.
  
- **Pathing Support**: Build paths using splines, straight lines, and turns, and chain them together for more complex maneuvers. The library provides flexible path generation options.

- **Kalman Filter**: An optional filter that can be added to improve sensor fusion and data accuracy. If no external sensors are available, the Kalman filter serves as a low-pass filter for reducing noise from odometry and IMU inputs.
